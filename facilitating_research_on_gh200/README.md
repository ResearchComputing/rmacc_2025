# Facilitating Research on the NVIDIA Grace Hopper Superchip: The CU Boulder Research Computing Experience 

NVIDIA's GH200 Grace Hopper Superchip offers strong potential for 
accelerating large-scale AI and HPC workflows through its tightly 
integrated CPU-GPU architecture. In this talk, we share CU Boulder 
Research Computing’s first-hand experience providing GH200 nodes 
to users. We'll cover the GH200 architecture, our approach to the 
software stack, an overview of our beta testing phase, and successful 
use cases run on the GH200s. We'll conclude with potential future 
directions for CURC’s GH200 resources and describe how RMACC members 
can access the nodes for their research or educational purposes.
